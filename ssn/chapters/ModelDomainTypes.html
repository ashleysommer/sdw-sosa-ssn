<h3>Domain types and FeatureOfInterest</h3>

<p>
    Actuations, Observations, and Samplings can be made on any entity in any application context.
    For many applications a domain-model will have been previously defined.
    This will include names and definitions for classes of entities in the domain.
    For example: applications in hydrology will refer to types such as water-course, stream, river, reach,
    storage, aquifer, lake, reservoir, spring, water-table, etc.
</p>
<p>
    A property of an instance of any domain type may be observed using a sensor, or changed using an actuator,
    or the entity may be sampled following a sampling procedure.
    When this occurs, the domain entity is the <em>feature-of-interest</em> of the Execution.
</p>
<p>
    Does this therefore require that classes in the domain model are defined as sub-classes of
    <code>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</code>?
    No, absolutely not.
    RDF and OWL entailments do not work that way.
</p>
<p>
    We will now examine the way that the SSN Ontology addresses this.
    Note that there are different implications depending on whether you are using the SOSA or SSN modules.
</p>

<h4>FeatureOfInterest in SOSA</h4>
<p>
    In SOSA the domain and range indications use the Schema.org predicates <code>schema:domainIncludes</code> and
    <code>schema:rangeIncludes</code>.
    In the case in question
</p>
<pre>
sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest 
  schema:domainIncludes sosa:Execution ;
  schema:rangeIncludes sosa:FeatureOfInterest ;
.
</pre>
<p>Note that</p>
<ol>
    <li>these have no formal entailments, they are just hints</li>
    <li>'Includes' means these types are non-exclusive, so any other type is acceptable, including types from
        application-domains</li>
</ol>
<p>
    So the 'domain and range' indications in SOSA are functionally harmless.
    The fact that
<pre>sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest schema:rangeIncludes sosa:FeatureOfInterest .</pre> merely says that things of type
<code>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</code> might be found as the object of hasFeatureOfInterest statements.
No more, no less.
</p>

<h4>FeatureOfInterest in SSN</h4>
<p>
    In SSN there are local (guarded) constraints, including the range of a property when it appears
    in the context of a member of a specific class.
    Related to the feature-of-interest, SSN has:
</p>
<pre>
sosa:Execution 
  rdfs:subClassOf [ 
    a owl:Restriction ; 
    owl:onProperty sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest ; 
    owl:allValuesFrom sosa:FeatureOfInterest ] ;
.
</pre>
<p>This says that, in the context of an individual <code>sosa:Execution</code>, the object of a
    <code>sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</code> is always an individual <code>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</code>.
</p>
<p>
    However, this does not mean that (i) the object of the statement must be declared to have
    <code>rdf:type sosa:FeatureOfInterest</code> in advance, and (ii) this is its only type.
    Rather, it means that
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        when an individual appears as the object of a statement
    </li>
    <li>
        whose subject is a <code>sosa:Execution</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        and whose predicate is <code>sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</code>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    then it is automatically inferred to be of <code>rdf:type sosa:FeatureOfInterest</code> <em>in addition to</em>
    any other information that was already available about it, including any pre-existing type.
</p>
<p>Note that this constraint does not require you to derive domain types as sub-classes of
    <code>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</code>.
    It could be argued that would be an error.
    It merely says that when a domain individual participates in an Execution (e.g. an Observation) it becomes a
    member of the class <code>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</code> in addition to any pre-existing domain class.
    Membership in the class <code>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</code> does not need to be asserted explicitly, and does
    not need to be assigned prior to the involvement of an entity in a <code>sosa:Execution</code> (or one of its
    sub-classes).
</p>
<p>
    For example, the following is a potential scenario of an observation made on a domain feature:
</p>
<pre>
ex:YarraAboveDightsFalls rdf:type hydro:RiverReach . 

ex:o345 rdf:type sosa:Observation ;
    sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest ex:YarraAboveDightsFalls ;
    sosa:observedProperty hydro:elevation ; 
    sosa:hasSimpleResult "30."^^unit:M ;
    sosa:phenomenonTime [ a time:Instant ; time:inXSDDateTime "2024-07-15T13:30:00+10:00" ; ] ;
. 
</pre>
<p>
    The constraint quoted above entails:
    <code>ex:YarraAboveDightsFalls rdf:type sosa:FeatureOfInterest . </code>
    <em>in addition to</em> the type already asserted.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of set theory, <code>domainB:ClassA</code> has a non-empty intersection with
    <code>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</code> only when a member of <code>domainB:ClassA</code> participates in a
    Execution.
    Domain types are not features-of-interest unless they are involved in executions, and the additional typing
    happens to individual members of the class 'automatically', by entailment, and not to the domain class as a
    whole.
