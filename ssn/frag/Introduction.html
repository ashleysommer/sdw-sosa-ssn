  <h3>Sensor data and related concepts</h3>
  <p>Sensors are a major source of data available on the Web today.
    However, searching, reusing, integrating, and interpreting sensor data requires more than just the sensing results.
    For the proper interpretation of these values, knowledge of the feature of interest, such as a river, the observed
    property, such as flow velocity, the sampling strategy, such as the specific locations and
    times at which the velocity was measured, and a variety of other information are required.
  </p>
  <p>
    OGC's Sensor Web Enablement standards [[[SWE]]], [[[SensorML]]], [[[OandM]]], [[[OMS]]], [[[STA]]] provide
    conceptual models, as well as some encodings for the annotation of sensors and their observations.
    Integration and alignment of these with W3C Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data embeds this in a global and
    densely interconnected graph of data.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the rise of the Web of Things and smart cities and homes more generally, actuators and the data they produce
    also become first-class citizens of the Web.
    Given their close relation to sensors and observations, it is desirable to provide an ontology that also includes
    actuators and actuation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, with the increasing diversity of data and data providers, definitions for sensors need to be broadened, to
    include human agents and social sensing.
  </p>
  <p>
    This specification defines the Semantic Sensor Network (<b>SSN</b>) ontology.
    It sets out to provide flexible but coherent perspectives for representing the entities, relations, and activities
    involved in sensing, sampling, and actuation.
    A lightweight core for SSN, known as <b>SOSA</b> (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) aims at broadening the
    target audience and application areas that do not need the full capabilities of Semantic Web ontologies.
    SOSA acts as minimal interoperability fall-back level, i.e., it defines terms (classes and properties) with which
    data
    can be safely exchanged across all uses of SSN, its modules, and SOSA.</p>

<section id="origins">

  <h3>Origins of SSN and SOSA</h3>
  <p>The initial SSN - now known as <b>SSNX</b> [[[SSNX]]] - was based on work by the <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/wiki/Main_Page">W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group</a> and
    the OGC's Sensor Web Enablement [[[SWE]]].
  </p>
  <p>Starting in 2002, the OGC's Sensor Web Enablement initiative [[[SWE]]] developed a generic framework for delivering
    sensor data, dealing with remote-sensing, moving platforms, and in-situ monitoring and sensing.
    In particular, the key standards SensorML and O&amp;M provided complementary viewpoints:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      SensorML [[[SensorML]]] is 'provider-centric' and encodes details of the sensor along with raw observation data
    </li>
    <li>
      O&amp;M [[[OandM]]] was designed to be more 'user-centric' with the target of the observation and the observed
      property as first-class objects.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    O&amp;M also provided a model for sampling, since almost all scientific observations are made on a subset of, or
    proxy for, the ultimate feature of interest.
  </p>


  <p>The initial Semantic Sensor Network ontology [[[SSNX]]] developed by the <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/wiki/Main_Page">W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group</a> was
    built around the <em>Stimulus Sensor Observation</em> (SSO) ontology design pattern [[[SSO-Pattern]]].
    The SSO was also aligned to the <em>Dolce-Ultralite </em>upper
    ontology [[[DUL]]]. </p>

  <p>The SSN ontology [[[vocab-ssn-20171019]]] combined key elements of SWE and SSNX, and added Actuation and Sampling as
    additional procedure execution types.
    The core classes and properties comprise the <em>Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator</em> (SOSA) module.
    SOSA acts as the central building block for the SSN and is packaged with very lightweight axiomatization so as to
    support use by web-developers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Following experience with O&amp;M since its publication as an ISO and OGC standard in 2011 [[[OandM]]], a revised
    edition was developed and published in 2023 [[[OMS]]].
    The new edition notably incorporated the Sampling class from SSN, as well as Sample and Observation collections,
    which had been proposed in an Extension to SSN [[[vocab-ssn-ext-20200116]]].
  </p>

  <p>
    This edition of the SSN Ontology has been primarily driven by a desire to incorporate elements from OMS, so that SSN
    may serve as the RDF implementation of OMS.
    In addition, developments in Internet of Things implementations, in particular [[[SAREF]]], [[[STA]]] and the OGC
    Connected Systems project.
    Finally, direct experience with SSN has uncovered a variety of issues that have been fixed or accommodated.
  </p>


  <p>The list below highlights the most important (but by far not exclusive) updates.</p>

  <p><b>Further work needed below here</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Addressing changes in scope and audience</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The initial SSN was developed with ontology engineers in mind as the primary audience. Due to the
          widespread adoption of SSN, the increasing role of citizen science, the strong focus on lightweight
          vocabularies by the Linked Data community, and vocabularies such as Schema.org, the ontology was
          streamlined. SOSA is added as a core, and is also useful as a standalone ontology targeting Web developers,
          citizen science, lightweight Linked Data publishing, resource-constraint IoT devices, data intensive
          applications (with the possibility of using lightweight reasoning), and so on. The new SSN introduces
          additional classes and relations on top of SOSA to model the capabilities of sensors and actuators, the
          compositionality of systems, and so forth to suit more complex needs or cases in which more provenance data
          is required, e.g., to improve reproducibility. </li>
        <li>Almost all scientific observations make heavy use of sampling strategies, and, therefore, the Sampling,
          Sampler, and Sample classes, as well as their corresponding properties, have been added to SOSA and SSN.
        </li>
        <li>Due to the increasing importance of the Web of Things and smart instrumentation and environments more
          generally, the classes Actuator and Actuation have been added to SOSA and SSN.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><strong>Addressing shortcomings of the initial SSN</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The new SSN streamlines the relations (and need for) the old Device, Platform, and Systems classes.</li>
        <li>The old SSN was perceived as too heavyweight (on its axiomatization) and too dependent on OWL reasoning by
          some users. To strike a balance, DL expressivity of the new lightweight SOSA ontology is ALI(D) which is
          efficiently supported by modern triple stores, while the new SSN is ALRIN(D). In contrast, the old SSN is
          SRIQ.</li>
        <li>The SSN previously imported DUL and many SSN terms inherited from DUL terms. Due to frequent user
          requests, this has been redesigned so that SSN (and SOSA) can be used entirely independently of DUL if
          desired. Some of the alignments with DUL have been reconsidered. Those parts of SSN that use DUL terms have
          been separated into the <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/dul">SSN Alignment with DUL ontology.</a> This
          alignment and therefore the role of DUL in SSN have been declared non-normative.</li>
        <li>The definitions for many classes and properties have changed slightly to improve explanation or to correct
          minor errors. Examples have been separated from the main definitions.</li>
        <li>The initial SSN has been criticized for its partially inconsistent handling of virtual sensors (including
          software and simulations) and related classes and properties. The new SSN and SOSA address this issue by
          allowing all major classes to be virtual, and to better support humans and other animals as agents.</li>
        <li>The notion of Procedure (formerly Plan) has been clarified to describe a workflow, protocol, plan,
          algorithm, or computational method specifying how to make an Observation, create a Sample, or make a change
          to the state of the world via an Actuator.</li>
        <li>The Observation class in the initial SSN was conceptualized as a subclass of the DUL Situation class. To
          improve alignment with O&amp;M and user expectations, as well as to follow a consistent modeling strategy
          for observations, sampling, and actuation, the Observation class defined in SOSA and the new SSN are now
          conceptualized as activities. </li>
      </ul>
    <li><strong>Addressing technical developments</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The initial SSN used local/guarded domain and range restrictions. The lightweight SOSA ontology uses an
          even more restrained axiomatization to foster wide reuse and adaptation among an audience that is not
          necessarily familiar with OWL. SOSA makes use of the <code>domainIncludes</code> and
          <code>rangeIncludes</code> annotation properties defined in Schema.org. These had not been available before.
        </li>
        <li>Given the increased interest in using Semantic Web technologies directly on the level of individual
          sensors, actuators, or platforms, SOSA's axiomatization does not use many of the more complex language
          elements introduced by SSN.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
