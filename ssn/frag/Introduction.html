  <h3>Sensor data and related concepts</h3>
  <p>Sensors are a major source of data available on the Web today.
    However, searching, reusing, integrating, and interpreting sensor data requires more than just the sensing results.
    For the proper interpretation of these values, knowledge of the feature of interest, such as a river, the observed
    property, such as flow velocity, the sampling strategy, such as the specific locations and
    times at which the velocity was measured, and a variety of other information are required.
  </p>
  <p>
    OGC's Sensor Web Enablement standards [[SWE]], [[SensorML]], [[OandM]], [[OMS]], [[STA]] provide
    conceptual models, as well as some encodings for the annotation of sensors and their observations.
    Integration and alignment of these with W3C Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data embeds this in a global and
    densely interconnected graph of data.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the rise of the Web of Things and smart cities and homes more generally, actuators and the data they produce
    also become first-class citizens of the Web.
    Given their close relation to sensors and observations, it is desirable to provide an ontology that also includes
    actuators and actuation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, with the increasing diversity of data and data providers, definitions for sensors need to be broadened, to
    include human agents and social sensing.
  </p>
  <p>
    This specification defines the Semantic Sensor Network (<b>SSN</b>) ontology.
    It sets out to provide flexible but coherent perspectives for representing the entities, relations, and activities
    involved in sensing, sampling, and actuation.
    A lightweight core for SSN, known as <b>SOSA</b> (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) aims at broadening the
    target audience and application areas that do not need the full capabilities of Semantic Web ontologies.
    SOSA acts as minimal interoperability fall-back level, i.e., it defines terms (classes and properties) with which
    data
    can be safely exchanged across all uses of SSN, its modules, and SOSA.</p>

  <h3>Origins of SSN and SOSA</h3>

  <h4>Sensor Web Enablement</h4>
  <p>Starting in 2002, the OGC's Sensor Web Enablement initiative [[SWE]] developed a generic framework for delivering
    sensor data, dealing with remote-sensing, moving platforms, and in-situ monitoring and sensing.
    In particular, the key standards SensorML and O&amp;M provided complementary viewpoints:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <em>SensorML</em> [[SensorML]] is 'provider-centric' and encodes details of the sensor along with raw observation
      data
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Observations and Measurements</em> (O&amp;M) [[OandM]] [[iso-19156-2011]] was designed to be more 'user-centric'
      with the target       of the observation and the observed       property as first-class objects.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    O&amp;M also provided a model for sampling, since almost all scientific observations are made on a subset of, or
    proxy for, the ultimate feature of interest.
  </p>

  <h4>Semantic Sensor Network</h4>
  <p>The initial Semantic Sensor Network ontology - now known as <b>SSNX</b> [[SSNX]] - was developed by the <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/wiki/Main_Page">W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group</a>.
    SSNX was influenced by SWE, but was primarily built around the <em>Stimulus Sensor Observation</em> (SSO) ontology
    design pattern [[SSO-Pattern]].
    The SSO was also aligned to the <em>Dolce-Ultralite </em>upper ontology [[DUL]]. </p>

  <h4>SSN Ontology</h4>
  <p>The SSN Ontology [[vocab-ssn-20171019]] combined key elements of SWE and SSNX, and added Actuation and Sampling as
    additional procedure execution types.
    The core classes and properties comprised the <em>Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator</em> (SOSA) module.
    SOSA acts as the central building block for the SSN and is packaged with very lightweight axiomatization so as to
    support use by web-developers.
  </p>

  <p>For details on the design philosophy and decisions around the SSN Ontology, please consult chapter "3. Origins of
    SSN and SOSA" in [[[vocab-ssn-20171019]]].</p>

  <h4>New edition of the SSN Ontology</h4>
  <p>
    Following experience with O&amp;M since its publication as an ISO and OGC standard in 2011 [[OandM]] [[iso-19156-2011]],
    a revised edition <em>Observations, Measurements and Samples</em> (OMS) was developed and published in 2023 [[OMS]]
    [[iso-19156-2023]].
    The new edition notably incorporated the <code>Sampling</code> class from SSN, as well as some features which had
    been proposed in an Extension to SSN [[vocab-ssn-ext-20200116]], in particular the notion of <i>ultimate</i>
    feature-of-interest, as well as Sample and Observation <i>collections</i>.
  </p>

  <p class="note">OMS was published by ISO 19156:2023 [[iso-19156-2023]], but is freely available as OGC Abstract Specification
    - Topic 20 [[OMS]].</p>

  <p>
    This new edition of the SSN Ontology has been primarily driven by a desire to align with OMS, so that SSN may serve
    as the RDF implementation of OMS.
    In addition, developments in Internet of Things implementations, in particular [[[SAREF]]], [[[STA]]] and the OGC
    Connected Systems project have contributed some ideas particularly around actuation.
    Finally, direct experience with SSN has uncovered a variety of more minor issues that have been addressed or
    accommodated.
  </p>

  <p>A change log is provided in an Annex of this document.
    The current change log describes the changes since the 2017 edition [[vocab-ssn-20171019]].
