<p class="note">
    Class diagrams are informative. 
    <br><br>
    They use a notation similar to UML, with boxes for classes, and associations or class attributes for properties. 
    However the diagrams MUST NOT be interpreted according to strict UML rules.
    <br><br>
    In particular:
    <br>- Cardinalities are not shown and should not be inferred 
    <br>- Object properties are generally shown as association roles. Exceptions are (i) if a target class is unspecified (ii) to reduce clutter, in which case object properties appear as class attributes, alongside the datatype properties
    <br>- Classes and properties coloured grey are included in the diagram for context, but are not described in this section 
    <br><br>
    The purpose of the diagrams is primarily to orient the reader as to how SSN properties are relate the SSN classes for most purposes. 
    The associations shown in the diagrams match the soft axioms <code>schema:domainIncludes</code> and <code>schema:rangeIncludes</code> in the ontology. 
    However, in any diagram the associations and attributes are not exhaustive: other associations exist but are not shown where their presence in the diagram would distract from the primary message.
