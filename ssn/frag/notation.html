        <p>
            Class diagrams are informative.
        </p>
        <p> Class and property diagrams use a notation similar to UML class diagrams, with boxes for classes, and
            associations or class attributes for properties.
            However the diagrams MUST NOT be interpreted according to strict UML rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            In particular:
            <br>- Cardinalities are not shown and should not be inferred
            <br>- Object properties are generally shown as association roles. Exceptions are (i) if a target class is
            unspecified (ii) to reduce clutter, in which case object properties appear as class attributes, alongside
            the datatype properties
            <br>- Classes and properties coloured grey are included in a diagram for context, but are described in
            a different section of the document
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of the diagrams is primarily to orient the reader as to how SSN properties are related to the
            SSN classes for most purposes.
            The associations shown in the diagrams match the soft axioms <code>schema:domainIncludes</code> and
            <code>schema:rangeIncludes</code> in the ontology.
            However, in any diagram the associations and attributes are not exhaustive: other associations exist but are
            not shown where their presence in the diagram would distract from the primary message.
